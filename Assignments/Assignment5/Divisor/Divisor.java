/*
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest integer that evenly divides each of the two numbers. 
Write a method gcd that returns the greatest common divisor of two integers. [Hint: You might want to use Euclidâ€™s algorithm. 
You can find information about it at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm.] 
Incorporate the method into an application that reads two values from the user and displays the result.
