/*
Implement the Shape hierarchy shown in Fig.9.3 . 
Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain method getArea
 to calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape. 
Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have methods getArea 
and getVolume to calculate the surface area and volume, 
respectively, of the three-dimensional shape. 
Create a program that uses an array of Shape references 
to objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy. 
The program should print a text description of the 
object to which each array element refers. 
Also, in the loop that processes all the shapes in the array, 
determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a ThreeDimensionalShape. 
If it’s a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area. 
If it’s a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its surface area and volume.
